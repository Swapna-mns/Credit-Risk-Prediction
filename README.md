# Credit Risk Prediction

This project predicts the probability of loan default using machine learning algorithms.  
The goal is to help financial institutions identify high-risk customers and improve loan approval decisions.

##  Project Overview
Credit risk prediction is a key task in banking and finance.  
In this project, we:

- Load and explore the credit risk dataset  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Visualize patterns and identify risk indicators  
- Train multiple machine learning models  
- Evaluate and compare model performance  


##  Steps Performed

###  Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Scaled numerical features  
- Checked class imbalance  
- Split data into train/test sets  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized credit amounts, ages, loan purposes  
- Identified correlations and risk factors  
- Plotted distributions using Matplotlib/Seaborn  

###  Machine Learning Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  

###  Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- F1-Score  
- Precision/Recall  

(You can fill the exact numbers below once you get results.)
